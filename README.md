## Description
In a world where we can get almost anything with a push or a click, it is no surprise that we have shifted a lot of our social 
activity to digital space. People craving social contact can log onto a variety of websites to chat with others who want the 
same thing. 
We have created an online space where users communicate with one another through text-based messages.
